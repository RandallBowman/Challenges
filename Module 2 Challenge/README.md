# Summary:
  1. The advantages of refactoring code are that hopefully when you take a second look at the code you can come up with a clearer way to implement the solution.
  2. My original VBA script was not developed with speed of execution in mind. The goal of my code was to create something that was configurable in the case that the data was different. I created constants that can be changed if needed so that the values don't have to be changed throughout the code. I also put some of the logic in subroutines to make the higher level code more readable. This caused a performance hit.
